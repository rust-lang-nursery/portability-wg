# Portability Working Group

> Coordination repository of the portability Working Group (WG)

This repository [issue tracker] is used by the portability WG to coordinate efforts towards making Rust
portable to new platforms.

[issue tracker]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/portability-wg/issues

## Vision

> Rust is really super portable. It supports a lot of platforms. But not enough 
> … not nearly enough. Rust wants to be everywhere, in wild places that only 
> future generations will be able to imagine. We’ve got some work yet to enable 
> that future though, and it is our responsibility to the Rusting world to do 
> so!

Some concrete goals:

* Support in `std` for non-Unix, non-Windows platforms.
  * Support for platforms that don’t have or require libc. The `std` API surface is already designed to accomodate this, but not the implementation.
* Reduced maintenance burden for ports. Porting std today requires touching too many parts of the libraries, and those parts must be maintaned by the std maintainers. In general, day-to-day maintenance should not require dealing with platform-specific code, especially for lesser-maintained ports.
* Rust developers should be aware when they use non-portable interfaces, so that they can avoid them or at least plan for them.
* Most of Rust's crate ecosystem should be usable on any platform with ease.
